#I've decided to use native R to discuss the syntax and formatting of this example template.  By using include=FALSE in the R chunk definition I have effectively kept it from being included in the final product.  When using this template the template intoduction and all R chunks with "infobox" labels can be removed.

#Climate and Plant Distribution

As the strongest of the five state factors that control ecosystems processes and structure, climate influences plant distribution across the globe through two features: temperature and precipitation. Annual minimum temperature limits the expansion of vegetation when it exceeds a species lethal threshold for survival. For example, at temperatures below -15oC, the probability of intracellular ice formation increases for the majority of broad-leaved, evergreen trees, while conifers from the boreal regions survive at temperatures below -40oC. Although grassland is spread out in a wide range of latitude and altitudes, C3 and C4 grasses respond differently to temperature and moisture, with C4 grasses predominant in tropical and Southern hemisphere latitudes, while C3 grasses prevail in areas with minimum temperatures below 15oC.

#Humification as a theory is unsupported

Explain how humication theory is unsupported.

#above is the first example of inserting an image into your Rmarkdown file.  the '![]()' syntax is used.  You start with an '!'.  Then Within the brakets [] you include the text that you want included as the figure caption.  Then Within the parentheses () you include the link to where the image can be found; the image is from the web in the above example.  I have also nested the link to Schmidts paper's DOI within the figure text which is why it appears complicated.  Below is a similar example with a different image.  Remember you will be copying this template and, though trial and error, it will begin to make sense... and if it doesnt, we'll help you in class.

Discuss the emerging understandings in stabilization mechanisms.

#Rethinking the Conceptual Theory of SOM Sequestration

As paradigms have shifted, its important to get away from humification terminology and embrace mechanistic theories and conceptualizations of soil carbon stabilization.

![Figure 3. The soil continum model (SCM) is an attempt to bring together disparate conceptualizations of soil carbon storage, which is an important step forward in soil science as we try to determine the best measurement and modeling techniques to predict SOC changes.

#Moving forward: bringing together theory, measurement, and modeling

Theory, measurement, and modeling need to be thought of as a single process to close the loop of the scientific method and create usable products to not just inform further science, but also provide farmers, land managers, policy makers, and the general public a tool to understand soil carbon.
